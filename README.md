Homeworks for 4370 - Interactive Computer Graphics

HW 1: Rasterizer
  This homework was an introduction to computer graphics principles. The class was introduced the the concept of rasterizing algorithms
  and worked on a rasterizer using the float point midpoint line algorithm for drawing lines. 

HW 2: OpenGL 
  This homework served as an introduction to the OpenGl pipeline and how to develop pictures using OpenGl/Glut libraries.
  3D math and opengl basics were the focus of this homework.
  
HW 3: 3D Viewing and Shaders
 This homework helped the class better understand opengl by implementing the Phong shader model. We have to develop 
 a fragment and vertex shader that was explained in relation to the OpenGL pipeline. 
 
HW 4: Ray tracing
  The point of this homework was to develop the math required for ray tracing, lighting, and shading. 
  We needed to implement the phong shading model from HW3 into an environment that uses ray tracing for graphics.
